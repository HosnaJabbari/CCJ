# CCJ

##### Description
CCJ is a method for predicting the psuedoknotted secondary structures of RNA sequences.
     
##### Organization
Simfold is required to be installed as a library before using CCJ.    
Original CCJ is contained in the Original CCJ subdirectory.      
Both Modifed CCJ and Sparse CCJ are in the Sparse CCJ subdirectory.      
Sparse CCJ uses the least amount of memory and is recommended to be used.
